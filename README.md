```

Information regarding the images present in our train set is present inside `train_files.txt`and image information for validation set is present inside `valid_files.txt`. It's provided so that one can reproduce the results.

### Steps to Train the model
- Download the dataset and place its images and masks inside `dataset/images/` and `dataset/masks/` respectively.
- Run the jupyter notebook: `run.ipynb`

### Model Performance
We have trained the model upto 25 epochs and have shared the performance matrices and some sample results below.
